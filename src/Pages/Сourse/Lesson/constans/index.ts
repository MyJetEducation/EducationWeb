First of all we dream. But dreams don’t come true. Why is that so? 

Because after you understand what you dream about - you need to set a goal. Setting goals is the first and the most important step to financial success. Without goals, you aren’t able to track progress and celebrate milestones. When forming goals, it’s important to make them “S.M.A.R.T” goals: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound. 

Here are a few examples of SMART financial goals: 

  –  Buy a new car for $25,000 in 7 months         
  –  Make $10,000 from a rental property in one year              
  –  Increase savings by $30,000 this year 

You can see how all of these follow our S.M.A.R.T goal guidelines. Each goal is measurable and time-bound, making it easy to keep track and hold you accountable to a deadline. They are also specific and relevant to financial success and not impossible to achieve. These examples are much more powerful than vague goals such as “pay off debt soon” or “make more money.”

This financial habit is also scalable and can be done at various points throughout your year. For example, you can create a weekly goal of adding at least $10 to an investment account or a goal that states you will invest at least $500 into your retirement savings each month. 

It’s also important to make sure that you are setting both short-term and long-term financial goals. By having both, you’ll stay motivated while focused on working towards your financial future.
